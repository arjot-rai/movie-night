But the 11 bullets found in the bodies, together with the 5 remaining rounds in the assassin's magazine, amount to 16 cartridges for a gun that should normally hold 15. The investigating Swiss\/Swedish team from the neutral countries overseeing the DMZ suspects that another, unknown party was involved - all of which points to some sort of cover up. The truth is much simpler and much more tragic.","Director":"Chan-wook Park","Title":"Joint Security Area","Actors":"Yeong-ae Lee, Byung-hun Lee, Kang-ho Song, Tae-woo Kim","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"14 wins & 5 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2000","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZjI3NjFlOTktN2JhYy00NjhjLWFmYWYtMDk3ZTkwOWQwZTAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"South Korea","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller, War","Writer":"Seong-san Jeong, Hyun-seok Kim, Mu-yeong Lee, Chan-wook Park, Myeong-chan Park (comic), Sang-yeon Park (novel)"}
