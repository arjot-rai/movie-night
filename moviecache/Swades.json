It is to this India, which is colorful, heterogeneous and complex that Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan), a bright young scientist working as a project manager in NASA, returns to on a quest to find his childhood nanny. The film uses the contrast between the highly developed world of NASA, which has been at the forefront of advances in space research, and this world back home in India, which is at the crossroads of development. Mohan's simple quest becomes the journey that every one of us goes through in search of that metaphysical and elusive place called \"home\".","Director":"Ashutosh Gowariker","Title":"Swades","Actors":"Shah Rukh Khan, Gayatri Joshi, Kishori Ballal, Smit Sheth","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"13 wins & 23 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2004","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BYzExOTcwNjYtZTljMC00YTQ2LWI2YjYtNWFlYzQ0YTJhNzJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"India","Genre":"Drama","Writer":"M.G.
