He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.","Director":"Martin Scorsese","Title":"Shutter Island","Actors":"Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"11 wins & 66 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2010","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BYzhiNDkyNzktNTZmYS00ZTBkLTk2MDAtM2U0YjU1MzgxZjgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"USA","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Writer":"Laeta Kalogridis (screenplay), Dennis Lehane (novel)"}
