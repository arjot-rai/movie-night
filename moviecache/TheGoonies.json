But when Mikey stumbles upon a treasure map of the famed \"One-Eyed\" Willy's hidden fortune, Mikey, Brandon, and their friends Lawrence \"Chunk\" Cohen, Clark \"Mouth\" Devereaux, Andrea \"Andy\" Carmichael, Stefanie \"Stef\" Steinbrenner, and Richard \"Data\" Wang, calling themselves The Goonies, set out on a quest to find the treasure in hopes of saving their neighborhood. The treasure is in a cavern, but the entrance to the cavern is under the restaurant of evil thief Mama Fratelli and her sons Jake Fratelli, Francis Fratelli, and the severely disfigured Lotney \"Sloth\" Fratelli.
