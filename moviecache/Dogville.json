Persuaded by Tom, the town agree to hide Grace, and in return she freely helps the locals. However, when the Sheriff from a neighbouring town posts a Missing notice, advertising a reward for revealing her whereabouts, the townsfolk require a better deal from Grace, in return for their silence; and when the Sheriff returns some weeks later with a Wanted poster, even though the citizens know her to be innocent of the false charges against her, the town's sense of goodness takes a sinister turn and the price of Grace's freedom becomes a workload and treatment akin to that of a slave. But Grace has a deadly secret that the townsfolk will eventually encounter.","Director":"Lars von Trier","Title":"Dogville","Actors":"Nicole Kidman, Harriet Andersson, Lauren Bacall, Jean-Marc Barr","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"21 wins & 32 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2003","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTkwNTg2MTI1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM1MzUyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, UK, France, Finland, Norway, Italy","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Writer":"Lars von Trier"}
