Henry roams from school to school, imparting modes of knowledge, but never staying long enough to form any semblance of sentient attachment. A perfect profession for one seeking to hide out in the open. One day Henry arrives at his next assignment. Upon his entry into this particular school, a secret world of emotion is awakened within him by three women. A girl named Meredith in his first period. A fellow teacher Ms. Madison, and a street hooker named Erica, whom Henry has personally granted brief shelter from the streets. Each one of these women, like Henry, are in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.","Director":"Tony Kaye","Title":"Detachment","Actors":"Adrien Brody, Marcia Gay Harden, James Caan, Christina Hendricks","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"8 wins & 4 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2011","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM3NzQzMDA5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA5NTcyNw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"USA","Genre":"Drama","Writer":"Carl Lund"}
