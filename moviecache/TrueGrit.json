To aid her, she hires the toughest U.S. marshal she can find, a man with \"true grit,\" Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn. Mattie insists on accompanying Cogburn, whose drinking, sloth, and generally reprobate character do not augment her faith in him. Against his wishes, she joins him in his trek into the Indian Nations in search of Chaney. They are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, who wants Chaney for his own purposes. The unlikely trio find danger and surprises on the journey, and each has his or her \"grit\" tested.","Director":"Ethan Coen, Joel Coen","Title":"True Grit","Actors":"Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 10 Oscars.
