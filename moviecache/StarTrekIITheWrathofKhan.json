Admiral James T. Kirk is an instructor at Starfleet Academy and feeling old; the prospect of attending his ship, the USS Enterprise--now a training ship--on a two-week cadet cruise does not make him feel any younger. But the training cruise becomes a deadly serious mission when his nemesis Khan Noonien Singh--infamous conqueror from late 20th century Earth--appears after years of exile. Khan later revealed that the planet Ceti Alpha VI exploded, and shifted the orbit of the fifth planet as a Mars-like haven. He begins capturing Project Genesis, a top secret device holding the power of creation itself, and schemes the utter destruction of Kirk.","Director":"Nicholas Meyer","Title":"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan","Actors":"William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"3 wins & 9 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"1982","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMzcyYWE5YmQtNDE1Yi00ZjlmLWFlZTAtMzRjODBiYjM3OTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"USA","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Writer":"Gene Roddenberry (based on \"Star Trek\" created by), Harve Bennett (story), Jack B.
