He had come to town many years before, a lawyer by profession. The stage was robbed on its way in by the local ruffian, Liberty Valance, and Stoddard has nothing to his name left save a few law books. He gets a job in the kitchen at the Ericson's restaurant and there meets his future wife, Hallie. The territory is vying for Statehood and Stoddard is selected as a representative over Valance, who continues terrorizing the town. When he destroys the local newspaper office and attacks the editor, Stoddard calls him out, though the conclusion is not quite as straightforward as legend would have it.","Director":"John Ford","Title":"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance","Actors":"John Wayne, James Stewart, Vera Miles, Lee Marvin","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.
