At the heart of it all is The Little Girl, who's being prepared by her mother for the very grown-up world in which they live - only to be interrupted by her eccentric, kind-hearted neighbor, The Aviator. The Aviator introduces his new friend to an extraordinary world where anything is possible. A world that he himself was initiated into long ago by The Little Prince. It's here that The Little Girl's magical and emotional journey into her own imagination - and into the universe of The Little Prince - begins. And it's where The Little Girl rediscovers her childhood and learns that ultimately, it's human connections that matter most, and that what's truly essential can only be seen with the heart.","Director":"Mark Osborne","Title":"The Little Prince","Actors":"Jeff Bridges, Mackenzie Foy, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"6 wins & 14 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2015","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNjg0OTM5OTQyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg5NDQ0NTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"France, Canada, Italy, USA, China","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama, Family, Fantasy","Writer":"Irena Brignull (original screenplay by), Bob Persichetti (original screenplay by), Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (based on \"Le Petit Prince\" by)"}
