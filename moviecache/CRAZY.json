Zac feels somewhat disconnected to his brothers, all of whom are different from each other. They include the bookworm Christian who is the eldest, the dumb jock Antoine who is third, and the youngest Yvan. But Zac has the most contempt for his second eldest brother, the shiftless druggie Raymond. To his devout Catholic mother, Zac is her miracle son, both for being born the same day as Jesus Christ (a fact which Zac has always hated), and because a Tupperware-selling mystic once told her that he has the power to heal. Laurianne has always coddled Zac, the two who have a special if unspoken bond. But Zac wants more to please his father, who wants more than anything in his sons that they grow up to be man's men and not sissies. As Zac goes through his mid-teens to early twenties, Zac isn't sure if he can live up to the ideals of either his mother or especially his father. A young man with stress-induced asthma, Zac just wants to be what he considers normal, which includes getting rid of his asthma. But more importantly, he wants to get rid of the underlying thoughts that he has and which most going through puberty have, but that for him are becoming more prevalent as he grows older.","Director":"Jean-Marc Vallée","Title":"C.R.A.Z.Y.","Actors":"Michel Côté, Marc-André Grondin, Danielle Proulx, Émile Vallée","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"38 wins & 8 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2005","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTU3MDc2MjUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQyMDAzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"Canada","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Writer":"François Boulay, Jean-Marc Vallée"}
