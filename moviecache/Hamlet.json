In a supernatural episode, he discovers that his uncle, whom he hates anyway, murdered his father. In an incredibly convoluted plot--the most complicated and most interesting in all literature--he manages to (impossible to put this in exact order) feign (or perhaps not to feign) madness, murder the \"prime minister,\" love and then unlove an innocent whom he drives to madness, plot and then unplot against the uncle, direct a play within a play, successfully conspire against the lives of two well-meaning friends, and finally take his revenge on the uncle, but only at the cost of almost every life on stage, including his own and his mother's.","Director":"Kenneth Branagh","Title":"Hamlet","Actors":"Riz Abbasi, Richard Attenborough, David Blair, Brian Blessed","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 4 Oscars.
