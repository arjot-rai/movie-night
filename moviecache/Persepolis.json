However as Marji grows up, she witnesses first hand how the new Iran, now ruled by Islamic fundamentalists, has become a repressive tyranny on its own. With Marji dangerously refusing to remain silent at this injustice, her parents send her abroad to Vienna to study for a better life. However, this change proves an equally difficult trial with the young woman finding herself in a different culture loaded with abrasive characters and profound disappointments that deeply trouble her. Even when she returns home, Marji finds that both she and homeland have changed too much and the young woman and her loving family must decide where she truly belongs.","Director":"Vincent Paronnaud, Marjane Satrapi","Title":"Persepolis","Actors":"Chiara Mastroianni, Danielle Darrieux, Catherine Deneuve, Simon Abkarian","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.
