Mrs. Chasen is determined for Harold to be \"normal\", including she sending him into therapy to deal with his issues and finding him a girlfriend through a computer dating service. It is at a series of funerals that Harold meets Maude, on the cusp of her eightieth birthday, she who too attends funerals of strangers. Unlike Harold, Maude is obsessed with life - her own life to be more precise - she doing whatever she wants to please herself, damned what others may think or how they may be affected. Since she can't take material possessions with her, she is more interested in experiences, with whatever material possessions she has - often \"borrowed\" without asking - only to further those experiences. Their friendship is initially based on how the other can further their own priority. But as Maude shows Harold how to truly live, Harold falls in love with her. Their relationship, already limited in time by the sheer math, is curtailed even more as Maude shows him only not how to live well, but die well.","Director":"Hal Ashby","Title":"Harold and Maude","Actors":"Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort, Vivian Pickles, Cyril Cusack","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 2 Golden Globes.
