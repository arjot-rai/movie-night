They wait for dark, trading insults and even finding some common ground; sometimes one has the gun, sometimes the other, sometimes both. Things get complicated when another wounded Bosnian comes to, but can't move because a bouncing mine is beneath him. The two men cooperate to wave white flags, their lines call the UN (whose high command tries not to help), an English reporter shows up, a French sergeant shows courage, and the three men in no man's land may or may not find a way to all get along.","Director":"Danis Tanovic","Title":"No Man's Land","Actors":"Branko Djuric, Rene Bitorajac, Filip Sovagovic, Georges Siatidis","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar.
