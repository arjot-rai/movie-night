It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy AwardÂ®-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.","Director":"Paul Greengrass","Title":"Captain Phillips","Actors":"Tom Hanks, Catherine Keener, Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 6 Oscars.
