Without the chemical substances, he would not have the energy to keep up with his girlfriend, his ex-wife, and his special dancing daughter. They attempt to bring him back from the brink, but it's too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. He chain-smokes, uses drugs, sleeps with his dancers and overworks himself into open-heart surgery. Scenes from his past life start to encroach on the present and he becomes increasingly aware of his mortality.","Director":"Bob Fosse","Title":"All That Jazz","Actors":"Roy Scheider, Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking, Leland Palmer","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Won 4 Oscars.
