Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Hagrid, the grounds keeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer.

He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.","Director":"Chris Columbus","Title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","Actors":"Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Saunders Triplets","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 3 Oscars.
