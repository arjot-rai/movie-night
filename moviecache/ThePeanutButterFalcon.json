It's a Southern living in the world of a modern Mark Twain that begins when Zak, a 22-year-old young man with Down syndrome runs away from a nursing home to chase his dream of becoming a professional wrestler by attending the wrestling school of The Salt Water Redneck. Through circumstances beyond their control Tyler (29), a small time outlaw on the run becomes Zak's unlikely wrestling coach and ally, and together they wind through deltas & marshes, elude capture, drink whisky, find God, catch fish, and convince Eleanor (27) a beautiful nursing home employee to join them on their journey rather than returning Zak to his previous life.","Director":"Tyler Nilson, Michael Schwartz","Title":"The Peanut Butter Falcon","Actors":"Zack Gottsagen, Ann Owens, Dakota Johnson, Bruce Dern","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"21 wins & 16 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2019","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOWVmZGQ0MGYtMDI1Yy00MDkxLWJiYjQtMmZjZmQ0NDFmMDRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg3MDMxNzU@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"USA","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Writer":"Tyler Nilson, Michael Schwartz"}
