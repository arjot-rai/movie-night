Gathering up the men is a tale in itself but after a bit of a party at Camelot, many decide to leave only to be stopped by God who sends them on a quest: to find the Holy Grail. After a series of individual adventures, the knights are reunited but must face a wizard named Tim, killer rabbits and lessons in the use of holy hand grenades. Their quest comes to an end however when the police intervene - just what you would expect in a Monty Python movie.","Director":"Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones","Title":"Monty Python and the Holy Grail","Actors":"Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"3 wins & 3 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"1975","Poster":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BN2IyNTE4YzUtZWU0Mi00MGIwLTgyMmQtMzQ4YzQxYWNlYWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"UK","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Writer":"Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin"}
