Two parallel and intercut stories dramatize men about to die: both are estranged from a grown child, both want to make contact, and neither child wants anything to do with dad. Earl Partridge's son is a charismatic misogynist; Jimmy Gator's daughter is a cokehead and waif. A mild and caring nurse intercedes for Earl, reaching the son; a prayerful and upright beat cop meets the daughter, is attracted to her, and leads her toward a new calm. Meanwhile, guilt consumes Earl's young wife, while two whiz kids, one grown and a loser and the other young and pressured, face their situations. The weather, too, is quirky.","Director":"Paul Thomas Anderson","Title":"Magnolia","Actors":"Pat Healy, Genevieve Zweig, Mark Flanagan, Neil Flynn","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 3 Oscars.
