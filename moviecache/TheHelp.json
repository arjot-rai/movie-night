Aibileen (Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up -- to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly -- and unwillingly -- caught up in the changing times.","Director":"Tate Taylor","Title":"The Help","Actors":"Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar.
