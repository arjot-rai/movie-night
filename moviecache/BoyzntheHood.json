Half-brothers Doughboy and Ricky Baker are foils for each other's personality, presenting very different approaches to the tough lives they face. Ricky is the 'All-American' athlete, looking to win a football scholarship to USC and seeks salvation through sports, while 'Dough' succumbs to the violence, alcohol, and crime surrounding him in his environment, but maintains a strong sense of pride and code of honor. Between these two is their friend Tre, who is lucky to have a father, 'Furious' Styles, to teach him to have the strength of character to do what is right and to always take responsibility for his actions.","Director":"John Singleton","Title":"Boyz n the Hood","Actors":"Hudhail Al-Amir, Lloyd Avery II, Angela Bassett, Miya McGhee","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars.
