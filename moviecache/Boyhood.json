Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.","Director":"Richard Linklater","Title":"Boyhood","Actors":"Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Elijah Smith, Lorelei Linklater","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar.
